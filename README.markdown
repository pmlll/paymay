## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run PayMay locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or Yarn
- Firebase account and project setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paymay.git
   cd paymay
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firestore and Authentication (e.g., email/password provider).
   - Add your Firebase configuration to `src/firebase/config.js`:
     ```javascript
     export const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your-api-key",
       authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
       projectId: "your-project-id",
       storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
       messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
       appId: "your-app-id"
     };
     ```
   - Configure Firestore rules to allow read/write for authenticated users:
     ```firestore
     rules_version = '2';
     service cloud.firestore {
       match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /{document=**} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

5. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The optimized build will be generated in the `build` folder, ready for deployment.

6. **Deploy to Firebase** (optional):
   - Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Login: `firebase login`
   - Initialize hosting: `firebase init hosting`
   - Deploy: `firebase deploy`

## üß™ Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page reloads on code changes, and lint errors appear in the console.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimized and minified for performance. See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more.
- **`npm run eject`**: Ejects from Create React App for full control over configuration (irreversible).
